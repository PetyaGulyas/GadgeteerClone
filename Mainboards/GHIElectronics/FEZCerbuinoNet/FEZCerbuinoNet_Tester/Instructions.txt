FEZCerbuinoNet Tester
---------------
Last Updated: 8/7/2014 by John
Firmware Version: 4.3.3.0

Instructions
------------
1. Power the mainboard.
2. Load the loader using the STDFU tester.
3. Load the firmware using MFDeploy.
4. Insert a micro sd card and ethernet cable.
5. Verify the LED near the black power jack turned on.
6. Plug an LED strip into each of the three sockets.
7. Verify each LED on each strip turns on and off.
8. Place an LED between ground and the ports labeled D0 through D13 
   and A0 through A5 along the sides of the board.

Passing
-------
Shortly after inserting the micro sd card and the ethernet cable,
the led near the black power jack should turn red. All LEDs on 
sockets 1, 2, and 3 and the ports along the sides should blink on 
and off. 

Notes
-----
- If the LED fails to turn on after inserting the sd card and ethernet
  cable, remove them, remove and then re-add power to the mainboard, 
  and try again.
- To test the individual ports along the sides of the boards, you can 
  connect a BreadBoardX1 to one of the three sockets and place a wire
  between LED1 on the BreadBoardX1 and the port to be tested on the
  mainboard.
- The loader and firmware files can be found in the correct version 
  of the firmware folder (the same used for testing modules) under 
  FEZ Cerberus.
- Only test the LEDs after after you have tested the SD card and ethernet.
