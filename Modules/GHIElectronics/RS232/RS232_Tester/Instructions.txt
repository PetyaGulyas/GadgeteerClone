RS232 Tester
---------------
Last Updated: 7/21/2014 by John
SDK Version: 4.3.2.0

Instructions
------------
1. Connect an RS232 module to socket 1 and 4.
2. Connect the provided cable to both modules.
3. Power the mainboard.

Passing
-------
After a brief delay on starting the board, "Passed" will be 
displayed on the screen. If passed is not displayed or "Failed"
is displayed, test the module once more and if the same behavior
occurs again, the module is bad.

Notes
-----
- You must restart the mainboard between tests.
- If it is easier, you can use the same known good module on 
  socket 1 and only swap out the module on socket 4 between tests.
