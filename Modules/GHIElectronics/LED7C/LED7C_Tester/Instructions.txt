2. Power the mainboard.

Passing

Each LED7C will, at the same time, cycle through the colors red, green, blue, 
white, and then off, in that order. Each color will be lit for just under one
second.

- You may plug and unplug modules without restarting the mainboard.
- You may plug in only one module at a time if it is easier to test.
