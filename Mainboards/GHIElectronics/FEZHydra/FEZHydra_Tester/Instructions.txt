Instructions
------------
1. Power the mainboard.
2. Load the loader and firmware onto the device.
3. Plug an LED strip into sockets 3 through 14.
4. Verify each LED on each strip turns on and off.

Passing
-------
On sockets 6 through 14, every LED on the strip will blink. On socket 5, 
all but LED 4 will blink. On sockets 3 and 4, only LEDs 0, 1, 2, and 3 will
blink. The green LED on the board will also blink.

Notes
-----

  of the firmware folder (the same used for testing modules) under 
  FEZ Hydra.
- You may use only one LED strip and move it along the sockets if
  you prefer.
