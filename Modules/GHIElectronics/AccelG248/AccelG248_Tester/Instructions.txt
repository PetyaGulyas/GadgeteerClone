---------------
Last Updated: 7/17/2014 by John
SDK Version: 4.3.2.0

Instructions
------------
1. Connect a AccelG248 module to socket 2.
2. Power the mainboard.
3. Move the module around.

Passing
-------
When the module is held flat to a level surface, the third number
will read around 0.5 while the rest are near 0. If you turn it 
socket side down and level, the third number will then read around -0.5.

Notes
-----
- You may plug and unplug modules without restarting the mainboard.
- The graphs track the acceleration.
- Red is x, the first number. Green is y, the second number. Blue is
  z, the third number.
- You can use gravity to measure acceleration. As you move the module
  around you can observe the change in all three axes.
