---------------
Last Updated: 6/11/2014 by John
Firmware Version: 4.3.1.0

Instructions
------------
1. Connect a Load module to sockets 1, 9, and 18.
2. Power the mainboard.

Passing
-------
Every led on each Load module will turn on for 1 second when the 
screen says "LEDs on" and then turn off for one second when 
the screen says "LEDs off" and then repeat.


Notes
-----
- All leds will have the same state, either all on, or all off.
- You may plug and unplug modules without restarting the mainboard.
- You may plug in only one module at a time if it is easier to test.
