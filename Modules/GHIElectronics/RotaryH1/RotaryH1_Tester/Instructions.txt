Instructions
------------
1. Connect a module to sockets 1, 9, and 18.
2. Power the mainboard.
3. Turn the knob on each module to the left and the right.
4. As you turn, observe the two numbers after each socket
   label on the screen.

Passing

When the knob is facing you and you turn it counter-clockwise, the 
first number will increase and the second number will be zero. When
you turn it clockwise, the first number will decrease and the second
number will be one.

Notes
-----
- You must restart the mainboard between tests.
- You may plug in only one module at a time, but make sure to ignore 
  the values for the unplugged sockets.
