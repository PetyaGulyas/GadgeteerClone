Firmware Version: 4.3.2.0

Instructions
------------
1. Connect a RelayX1 to sockets 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
2. Power the mainboard.

Passing
-------
The relays will turn on for 1 second when the screen says "Relays on" 
and then turn off for one second when the screen says "Relays off" 
and then repeat.

Notes
-----
- All relays will have the same state, either all on, or all off.
- The relay is on when the onboard LED turns green on the module.
- You may plug and unplug modules without restarting the mainboard.
- You may plug in only one module at a time if it is easier to test.
